# xlines

### *x* lines of Python

An [Agile](http://www.agilegeoscience.com/) blog series exploring common geosciencey workflows in *x* lines, where ideally *x* &le; 10 but not necessarily, I haven't thought it through properly yet. These will be [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) running on [binder](http://mybinder.org/).

Click the `launch binder` button to start the interactive notebooks.
